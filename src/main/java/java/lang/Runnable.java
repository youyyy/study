/**
 * The <code>Runnable</code> interface should be implemented by any
 * class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
 * class must define a method of no arguments called <code>run</code>.
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 * wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
 * <code>Runnable</code> is implemented by class <code>Thread</code>.
 * Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
 * yet been stopped.
 * <p>
 * In addition, <code>Runnable</code> provides the means for a class to be
 * active while not subclassing <code>Thread</code>. A class that implements
 * <code>Runnable</code> can run without subclassing <code>Thread</code>
 * by instantiating a <code>Thread</code> instance and passing itself in
 * as the target.  In most cases, the <code>Runnable</code> interface should
 * be used if you are only planning to override the <code>run()</code>
 * method and no other <code>Thread</code> methods.
 * This is important because classes should not be subclassed
 * unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
 * behavior of the class.

 * Runnable表示一类无返回值，且不抛出异常的任务
 *
 * Runnable类任务通常由Thread直接执行，也可以交给【任务执行器】Executor去执行
 * 此外，Runnable还可以经过适配器的装配，与Callable类型、Future类型等配合使用
 *
 * 该接口已函数化：
 * Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
 *     @Override
 *     public void run() {
 *         System.out.println("Runnable");
 *     }
 * };
 * 可以简写为：
 * Runnable runnable = () -> { System.out.println("Runnable"); };
